# Predict Bike Sharing Demand Using Autogluon

In this project, I used the [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html) library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. I used [Tabular Prediction](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/tabular_prediction/index.html#) to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. This project demonstrates my ability to use AutoGluon to train several iterations of models and record my personal optimization of the problem.

Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

I submitted several entries to the competition and achieved a rank within Kaggle. I have also shared a report of findings.
